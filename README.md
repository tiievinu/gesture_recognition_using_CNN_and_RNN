# gesture_recognition_using_CNN_and_RNN
Project_7, IIITB and UPGRAD,to develop a feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote. 

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:
Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
Stop: Pause the movie
 
Each video is a sequence of 30 frames (or images). In the next couple of lectures, our subject matter expert Snehansu will walk you through the structure of the dataset.
