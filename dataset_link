The data is in a zip file. The zip file contains a 'train' and a 'val' folder with two CSV files for the two folders.
These folders are in turn divided into subfolders where each subfolder represents a video of a particular gesture.
Each subfolder, i.e. a video, contains 30 frames (or images).
Note that all images in a particular video subfolder have the same dimensions but different videos may have different dimensions.
Specifically, videos have two types of dimensions - either 360x360 or 120x160
